        In a normal linking scenario, the thing you need to link to has a URL of
        its own. But in this scenario, the page you want to link to and the page
        the link is on is one and the same -- so you've got to make up a name
        for the link's destination. I'd recommend using word or phrase that
        describes the link's destination. If you use a phrase, there should be
        no spaces -- use underscores instead. Example Let's say we wanted to
        link to an example of a company using Facebook ads in a post. Here's
        what I'd use as my object's name: facebook_ads_example
