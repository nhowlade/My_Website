          In a normal linking scenario, the thing you need to link to has a URL
          of its own. But in this scenario, the page you want to link to and the
          page the link is on is one and the same -- so you've got to make up a
          name for the link's destination. I'd recommend using word or phrase
          that describes the link's destination. If you use a phrase, there
          should be no spaces -- use underscores instead. Example Let's say we
          wanted to link to an example of a company using Facebook ads in a
          post. Here's what I'd use as my object's name: facebook_ads_example
