                    In a normal linking scenario, the thing you need to link to
                    has a URL of its own. But in this scenario, the page you
                    want to link to and the page the link is on is one and the
                    same -- so you've got to make up a name for the link's
                    destination. I'd recommend using word or phrase that
                    describes the link's destination. If you use a phrase, there
                    should be no spaces -- use underscores instead. Example
                    Let's say we wanted to link to an example of a company using
                    Facebook ads in a post. Here's what I'd use as my object's
                    name: facebook_ads_example
                </p>
                <a class="experience_page" href="experiences.html"
