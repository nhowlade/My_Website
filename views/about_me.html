          Hello I am Nadeem Howlader. I am a web programming enthusiast working
          towards getting my hands on all the amazing web technologies out
          there. I believe with my determination, skill and motivated mindset
          would help me to achieve my dream of becoming a web-developer. Hence,
          I work on myself continuously, learn something new every day and
          continue to grow towards making my vision a reality.
        </p>
        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I am Bangladeshi by origin and currently pursuing my dream in Canada.
          I have spent my childhood in Bangladesh, where I grew up learning
          about how great computers are. At first, when I was in grade 5, I
          thought all you could do with a computer was play games, but slowly I
          learnt that it was more capable than I could comprehend.<br /><br />Programming
          did not seem appealing to me at first, but slowly looking into it I
          had a complete change of heart. The journey began with me trying to
          implement a custom folder icon to my Windows 7 PC. It was quite
          satisfying, and I envisioned myself being able to control everything
          within a computer. I began to work hard to make my vision a reality.
          Passed my high school with remarkable results and then got accepted to
          the University of Guelph for studying Software Engineering.
        </p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          At 2018, I began my bachelors at the University of Guelph, Canada. I
          am studying Software Engineering(Co-op) under Bachelor of Computing.
          From my keen interest in Mathematics, I chose to pursue a minor in the
          subject alongside my degree. It has been three years I been in the
          University of Guelph and I must say I enjoyed every single day of it
          and look forward to the 2 years I have left to graduate.
        </p>
        <h2>Life In Canada</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I came to Canada with the sole aim to get direction and kickstart my
          career. I have learnt to take up the “good” parts from my work
          experiences and use them to grow as a person. My time as the
          University’s IT Help Centre staff allowed me to completely delve into
          how the corporate work life is and how crucial it is to keep improving
          in your field of expertise.
