        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This is going to be a blog post regarding my first co-op placement at
          the Computing and Communication Services(CCS) at the University of
          Guelph. It has been a wonderful 8 months working at CCS and I hope
          this short blog will provide a vivid picture of what I learnt during
          these months.
        </p>
        <h2>What is CCS?</h2>
        <div class="rp-text-2"><p>
          The University of Guelph’s Computing and Communication Services is
          also referred to as “CCS”. CCS provides core IT services to the
          greater campus community. CCS undertook many projects that are
          intended to improve life on campus, aid the launch of new and
          innovative collaboration tools, and continuously monitors the
          cyber-security.</br></br> Their services include not only network connectivity,
          information security, software distribution but they also help to
          fulfill the additional technical needs for various departments across
          campus. One of the purposes of CCS that really got my attention is to
          improve the quality of lives by enabling our community with
          technology. This got me really excited as giving back to the community
          is something that I always look forward to.

        <h2>My work at CCS</h2>
        <p>I was more on the front-line support group for the CCS, where everyday we would have to help clients with their daily IT troubles. Being on the front-line taught me a lot of things on the job but most of all, it provided me with the insight to solve real-life problems efficiently and make others life easier by educating them about the right way to use a certain tech. But amidst COVID-19, the situation was a little different.</br></br></p>
