        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This is going to be a blog post regarding my first co-op placement at
          the Computing and Communication Services(CCS) at the University of
          Guelph. It has been a wonderful 8 months working at CCS and I hope
          this short blog will provide a vivid picture of what I learnt during
          these months.
        </p>
        <h2>What is CCS?</h2>
        <div class="rp-text-2">
          <p>
            The University of Guelph’s Computing and Communication Services is
            also referred to as “CCS”. They provides core IT services to the
            greater campus community. CCS undertook many projects that are
            intended to improve life on campus, aid the launch of new and
            innovative collaboration tools, and continuously monitors the
            cyber-security.<br /><br />
            Their services include not only network connectivity, information
            security, software distribution but they also help to fulfill the
            additional technical needs for various departments across campus.
            One of the purposes of CCS that really got my attention is to
            improve the quality of lives by enabling our community with
            technology. This got me really excited as giving back to the
            community is something that I always look forward to.

        <h2>My work at CCS</h2>
        <p>
          I was more on the front-line support group for the CCS, where everyday
          we would have to help clients with their daily IT troubles. I was
          appointed as a Student IT Consultant at CCS. Being on the front-line
          taught me a lot of things on the job but most of all, it provided me
          with the insight to solve real-life problems efficiently and make
          others life easier by educating them about the right way to use a
          certain tech. But amidst
        </p>
        <p class="rp-text-italics">COVID-19</p>
        <p>
          , the situation was a little different.<br /><br />For my work term,
          we were approved to start working from home. Working from home meant
          to be consciously responsible for the work that was being handed out
          to us and timely submitting them back, but then again being able to
          work in the comfort of your porch was a completely different
          experience. We were a team of four coop students working remotely
          during Summer 2020. As the summer semester kicked off, we were helping
          both students and faculty with the transition to online learning. It
          was a challenge, but we handled the situation pretty nicely I must
          say.<br /><br />As part of the job description, I was expected to work with different operating systems, and I am glad to have worked with a couple of them beforehand. During my 2 years at the University, I learnt to work with Linux, Windows and MAC operating systems. Working with the Microsoft Office suite was a very common thing at the IT help desk and so having experience with was proved beneficial. We were also required to do some network troubleshooting especially Wi-Fi, this was something that I later on picked up while being in the job. Most importantly the job expected us co-ops to keep an open mind and use every opportunity to learn and grow with the values of CCS.
        </p>
        <h2>Work Term S20</h2>
        <h3>Goals and learnings</h3>
        <h2>Master multi-tasking to maintain productivity</h2>
        <p>Going into my first Co-op term, I wanted to be able to provide the best service I could to my employer. Working full-time provided me with lots of responsibilities and eventually I realised that it would best if I be able to multi-task. There would be times when I would have to search up multiple places to figure out the solution to a client’s issue. Moreover, if I feel resorting to multi-tasking was helped to maintain my productivity when working with clients, redesigning websites and making documentation to help others in the team.</p>
        <h2>Gain expertise over HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h2>
        <p>Since summer was fairly quiet at the University, our department decided to update some of the webpages. I already had a fair bit of interest in this project and so I got pretty excited on it. 
          Going into the project I had minimum knowledge about HTML and hence I decided to dive more into this. I decided to research into HTML and CSS and used that knowledge to build my website. At the same time, I progressed a lot into redesigning some pages for the CCS. Refactoring HTML code, updating screenshots at certain pages and even updating information on some pages were some core responsibilities me and my team were assigned to complete. For my personal website, I was working with a friend as he was redesigning his website. Both of us collaborated to learn SASS and Bootstrap, which we later implemented in our websites.
        </p>
        <h2>Working towards achieving good communication skills</h2>
        <p>Communication is a key skill in our day-to-day life. Being able to convey our thoughts to others makes our life quite easier. In my line of work, when clients used to be on a call and ask for help, it would be upon us to use the best possible methods to make them understand how to troubleshoot their issue. I volunteered to go more on calls with clients which helped me polish my communication skills. I also actively participated in meetings with the team and that helped me to be able to openly communicate with each other. Building healthy relationships with your coworkers is a blessing and having good communication skills definitely helps the process.</p>
        <h2>Work Term F20</h2>
        <h3>Goals and learnings</h3>
        <h2>Learning to use various web conferencing tools</h2>
        <h2>Usability testing new websites and software</h2>
        <h2>Adapting to corporate workplace culture</h2>
        <p>Being part of CCS has got me a lot closer to the corporate workplace culture during my stay in Canada. Since I plan to choose my career in Software engineering and currently enrolled in a Co-op program, I would have to work for many other corporations during my upcoming co-op semesters. To me every workplace has a different culture it adheres to and it is always expected by employers that we maintain the culture as well. In my time within CCS, I have experienced the ways our teams coordinate to do certain tasks and how learning these is crucial to be part of the organization.<br/>I feel learning from a workplace’s culture not only benefits you during your tenure at the workplace, but it keeps a long-lasting effect on you from that point on in life. Usually, these values help to improve oneself professionally and later these may help me look apart from the usual crowd and catch the eye of those who are looking for someone holding good workplace values.
